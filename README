Hi, this is version 1.03 of w3ng.

Thanks for taking the time to have a look at it. It's far from perfect, so
don't be suprised if things break, but please let me know what does break.

Ok, quick usage. First, stick w3ng into your /cgi-bin/ directory (or,
the directory that looks like /cgi-bin/ to the outside world). In a Web page, 
do the following:

<A HREF="/cgi-bin/w3ng?/dos/c/eh/myguide.ng+-menu">
     This is my test Norton Guide</A>

And away you go (I hope, works for me etc... <g>).

Ok, here are some of the things that are not perfect yet or that I need
other people to test and give me feedback with:

o Test it with as many NGs as possible.

o w3ng does some very rough low and high PC character translation. I did
  it in a rush so it's not going to look perfect. I will sit down and
  design the box character to ASCII chaarcter mapping, plus some other
  "special" picture characters, later.
	
o The source is partly ripped off from a NG reader I was writing for OS/2.
  Because of this it's possibly not optimized for the job in hand, please
  excuse the code at the moment (possibly some left over vars, very few
  comments etc..).

o My knowledge of HTML is not great. If you see any problems with the
  resulting HTML then please let me know.

o As far as I can tell, the source should compile clean with GCC under
  Linux, GCC under OS/2 (GCC/EMX), GCC under Dos (DJGPP) and Borland
  under Dos. If you find otherwise, or you find another compiler/OS
  that it either a) works with or b) you've made it work with then
  please let me know.

o There is no Makefile as yet. You should know how to compile, but, for
  those who don't, I've used:

	Linux
		gcc w3ng.c cfgfile.c -o w3ng
	OS/2 (EMX)
		gcc w3ng.c cfgfile.c -o w3ng.exe
	Dos (DJGPP)
		gcc w3ng.c cfgfile.c -o w3ng.out
		strip w3ng.out
		coff2exe w3ng.out
	Dos (Borland)
		bcc w3ng.c cfgfile.c

o I've now added a -href parameter to help create index pages on the fly.
  For example, on my server I've got a (quick and dirty) bash script as
  follows:

	#!/bin/sh

	echo Content-type: text/html
	echo
	echo
	echo "<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Directory Of Norton Guide Files</TITLE>
	echo "</HEAD>"
	echo "<BODY>"
	echo "<UL>"
	for ng_file in /dos/c/eh/*.ng
	do
		echo "<LI>$(w3ng $ng_file -href)"
	done
	echo "</UL></BODY></HTML>"

o w3ng now has a config file to allow you to control some HTML elements.
  To set the location of the config file edit the #define CONFIG_FILE
  that is close the top of the source. Make sure you make this the
  full name of the file and not just a point to it's location or anything.

  Currently, the following options are available:

  BODY=
  -----

  Use this to specify your own <BODY> element. For example, you may want
  a graphic background to your pages:

        BODY=<BODY BACKGROUND="http://www.trustno1.com/img/scully.gif">

  Note that what you are giving is the *whole* opening body command.

  FRAMES=
  -------

  If you have a browser that can work with frames (Netscape II for example)
  you can tell w3ng to work with framed HTML. Set it to anything that starts
  with Y or y to turn it on:

        FRAMES=yes please!

  FRAMECOLS=
  ----------

  This lets you specify the split for the frames. The default is 30% for
  the menu and 70% for the pages. You can set it like:

        FRAMECOLS=30%,70%

  Note that what you set is what will be included in the HTML.

  
Hmm, I think that is about that for the moment. Any feedback is a good
thing. If you think it can be improved then let me know. Email your
feedback to davep@hagbard.demon.co.uk

You may also want to check http://www.acemake.com/hagbard/w3ng.html for
details of the current version and known problems. 

Also, if you need to convert a NG to a set of HTML documents then you might
want to look at http://www.acemake.com/hagbard/ng2html.html.

Thanks for your time.
